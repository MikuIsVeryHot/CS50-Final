#### Description: The AP Quiz is a interactive quiz built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's main purpose is to inform users the difficulties of certain AP class by letting the user guess what percentage of test taker get 5 (The maximum score) on the exam. This project is developed version of an earlier project I did for AP CSP, it implement things I've learnt from 11 weeks of CS50. Some feature I implemented is application instantly indicates whether the chosen answer is correct or incorrect by changing the button's color to green (correct) or red (incorrect). The application keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed, showing how many questions were answered correctly. After answering a question, users can click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question. The quiz includes a set of predefined questions embedded directly within the JavaScript code. Each question is an object containing the question text and an array of possible answers. Each answer is an object itself, containing the answer text and a boolean indicating whether it is correct.
